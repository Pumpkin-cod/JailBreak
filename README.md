# JAILBREAK
Guess the shuffled word game,
similar to Hangman but due to certain redundancies decided to frame it in a different way other than how Hangman was framed. Since all the games were developed concurrently, we took the same approach to each game in development. The back end and front-end teams work with the initial template uploaded on the back-end GitHub repo, after any update members would push their version, and merging was done by Mr. Alex. To avoid redundancy, Jailbreak was decided collectively by the group that it should be made not a word guessing game like Hangman, but now the letters of the word used would be shuffled and displayed for the user to rewrite them in the correct order. 
HOW TO PLAY:
From the array of words, a random word is selected using the same number algorithm developed for previous games, the letters of this word is now shuffled and displayed on the screen for the user to guess the word, the user has just 3 tries and 10 seconds to get the word right or he/she loses.

RULES OF THE GAME:
•	The game ends if the user fails to guess the word right after 3 tries.
•	The user has 10 seconds to guess the word or he/she loses.
•	The words of the randomly selected word are shuffled.
Jailbreak is a fun and simple word guessing game that can be played by friends, family, or classmates. By following the rules and guidelines outlined in this documentation, you can enjoy hours of fun with this classic game.
